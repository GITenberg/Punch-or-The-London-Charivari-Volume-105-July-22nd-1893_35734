<h1>Punch, or the London Charivari</h1>

<h2>Volume 105, July 22nd 1893</h2>

<h3><i>edited by Sir Francis Burnand</i> </h3>
<hr class="full" />

<h2>A LONDON PEST.</h2>

<p>To an impartial observer
the public, philanthropic, and
municipal attempts to honour
the memory of the great and
good, if sometimes mistaken,
Earl of <span class="sc">Shaftesbury</span>, appear
to have been singularly unfortunate.
The West-End
Avenue that bears his name
is more full of music-halls,
theatres, pot-houses, and
curious property, than any
street of equal length and
breadth in the whole Metropolis.
Lord <span class="sc">Shaftesbury</span> may
not have been a Puritan, but
he was essentially a serious
man, and his sympathies were
more with Exeter Hall than
with the Argyle Rooms; and
yet, in the street which is
honoured by his name, it has
been found impossible to remove
the old title of this
historic place from the stone
<i>facade</i> of the Trocadero.</p>

<p>The fountain at Piccadilly
Circus, which has been unveiled
as the second of the
<span class="sc">Shaftesbury</span> memorials, is
surmounted by&mdash;what? Some
writers have called it a girl,
some have called it a boy;
many of the public, no doubt,
regard it as a mythological
bird, and it certainly looks
like the Bolognese Mercury
flying away with the wings of
St. Michael. We are told, on
authority, that it represents
Eros, the Greek god of love,
and his shaft is directed to a
part of London that, more
than any other part, at night,
requires the bull's-eye and
the besom of authority. The
"Top of the Gaymarket" is
in just as bad a condition as it
was when <i>Punch</i> directed attention
to it more than ten
years ago, and the <i>virus</i> since
then has extended as far eastward
as St. Martin's Lane.
Moll Flanders' Parade now
begins at St. James's Church
and ends with Cranbourne
Street. It is unfortunate, to
say the least of it, that Eros
has been selected to point at
this London Pestiduct, and the
sooner it is thoroughly cleansed
and the neighbourhood made
worthy of the Shaftesbury
Fountain, the better.</p>

<p class="ind1"><span class="sc">Delenda est Drubilana!</span>&mdash;The
Drury Lane Committee,
headed by the dauntless <span class="sc">James
O'Dowd</span>, have decided upon
approaching the Duke of <span class="sc">Bedford</span>
with a protest against his
Grace's present expressed intention
of pulling down the
Old Theatre within the next
two years. Probably the result
of this, the latest incident
in the interesting annals of
Old Drury, will simply be to
make another addition to the
well-known collection of "Rejected
Addresses."</p>

<h2>OUR OPERA.</h2>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>To hear sweet strains by <span class="sc">Glück</span> or <span class="sc">Gounod</span>,</p>
<p><span class="sc">Mascagni</span>, <span class="sc">Wagner</span>, one must, you know,</p>

<p class="i12">  Rank, wealth, and beauty;</p>
<p>Outside, Elysium is forgotten.</p>
<p>To clear away these slums, half rotten,</p>
<p class="i12">  Is no one's duty.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Inside, <span class="sc">Mascagni's</span> <i>Intermezzo</i>,</p>
<p>Though heard in many places, yet so</p>
<p class="i12">  Delightful ever;</p>
<p>Outside, cab touts and paper sellers,</p>
<p>And other people's pert <i>Sam Weller's</i>,</p>
<p class="i12">  Delightful never!</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Inside, some day, the newest, <i>Falstaff</i>,</p>
<p>Will occupy a far from small staff</p>
<p class="i12">  Of band and chorus;</p>
<p>Outside, as now, old slums ill-smelling,</p>
<p>And costermongers, shouting, yelling,</p>
<p class="i12">  Will be before us.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Once someone started building greatly,</p>
<p>Walls rose, arranged to form quite stately</p>
<p class="i12">  House, <i>foyers</i>, lobbies.</p>
<p>They stopped, extremely gaunt and lonely,</p>
<p>And, now the site is used, it's only</p>
<p class="i12">  A haunt of bobbies.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>So still Euterpe's home is hidden</p>
<p>In ill-paved slums, through which we've ridden</p>
<p class="i12">  With jolts that jerk us.</p>
<p>How unlike Paris! Did we follow</p>
<p>Her taste, we should enshrine Apollo</p>
<p class="i12">  At Regent Circus.</p>

<p>She lived, this prophetess, too late,</p>
<p>And plied an art that's out of date,</p>
<p>Another age had seen her gain</p>

<p>To have futurity unrolled!</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>In some Greek court where fountains play,</p>
<p>Or dwelling by the Appian way,</p>
<p>The prophetess would surely be</p>
<p>Besought by each Leuconoë,</p>
<p>And if for these she sometimes drew</p>
<p>A future pleasanter than true,</p>
<p>At least she gave them, you'll confess,</p>
<p>Anticipated happiness!</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Ah! times are changed, and nowadays</p>
<p>Such divination hardly pays;</p>
<p>There comes no more the crowds that used,</p>

<p><i>Sultan (amicably).</i> Welcome, dear <span class="sc">Abbas</span>! Take a seat, and a
pipe&mdash;take anything you have a mind to, and "make yourself at
home," as the accursed Giaours say.</p>

<p><i>Khedive (squatting).</i> Thanks, my dear&mdash;Suzerain! Yildiz Kiosk
feels, indeed, very home-like. More than my own Cairo does&mdash;when
<span class="sc">Cromer's</span> there. This Nichan-i-Imtiaz Order is really very becoming.
Pity you and I, <span class="sc">Abdul</span>, have to take "orders" from anybody
west of Alexandria!</p>

<p><i>Sultan (sotto voce).</i> And why <i>should</i> we?</p>

<p><i>Khedive (sulkily).</i> Well, the sons of burnt fathers <i>have</i> got the
upper hand of the Faithful, somehow&mdash;confound them!</p>

<p><i>Sultan (reading).</i> "Intelligence received here of late, from trustworthy
quarters in Egypt, indicates that the <span class="sc">Khedive's</span> journey is
to be made the point of departure for a <i>grande action diplomatique</i>
against British influence in the Valley of the Nile." That's from
the <i>Times</i>, my <span class="sc">Abbas</span>!</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg 27]</span>

<p><i>Khedive (moodily).</i> Humph! Wish the Egyptian
quarters <i>were</i> "trustworthy." <i>Grande action diplomatique?</i>
Quite makes one's mouth water!</p>

<p><i>Sultan.</i> <i>Doesn't</i> it? The same infernal&mdash;but
influential&mdash;news-sheet says: "The young <span class="sc">Khedive</span>
knows that not only would he meet with a personally
kindly reception, but that the grievances he
is known to be anxious to pour out would fall on
ready ears." There, at least, the Giaour "rag" is
right. Pour away, my <span class="sc">Abbas</span>! "Keep your eye on
your father&mdash;or Suzerain&mdash;and he will pull you
through."</p>
<p class="rindent">[<i>Winks and whiffs.</i></p>

<p><i>Khedive (whiffing and winking).</i> Will he, though?
And that Turkish Bodyguard?</p>

<p><i>Sultan (warmly).</i> At your service at any
moment, my dear <span class="sc">Abbas</span>!</p>

<p><i>Khedive (smoking furiously with closed eyes).</i>
Ah! if they would only let me alone, let me rule
my subjects in my own Oriental way&mdash;as you do
yours in Armenia, for example&mdash;then, indeed, I
could have a good time, and plenty of treasure.</p>

<p><i>Sultan (significantly).</i> Out of which my little
formal trifle of Tribute might come easily and
<i>regularly</i>&mdash;eh, <span class="sc">Abbas</span>?</p>

<p><i>Khedive.</i> Quite so, Padishah! Bah! These
brutal, blundering Britishers don't understand the
Art of Government as adapted to Eastern Ideas.</p>

<p><i>Sultan (soothingly).</i> Well, never mind, <span class="sc">Abbas</span>.
We'll lay our heads together, anon, now you <i>are</i>
here, and&mdash;who knows? Meanwhile, let's enjoy
ourselves. Something like a "Turkish Occupation"
this&mdash;eh? And how do you like this Turkish
tobacco?</p>

<p><i>Khedive (blowing vigorously).</i> Smokes easily,
and makes a big cloud. In which I fancy I can
see myself driving the British Lion out of the Nile
Valley at the point of the bayonet.</p>

<p><i>Sultan (dreamily).</i> And I picture myself comfortably
replenishing my Treasury with that Tribute!
Like music, ABBAS?</p>

<p><i>Khedive (uneasily).</i> Ye-e-e-s. Why!</p>

soothing.</p>

<h3>A VISION OF ROYALTY.</h3>

<h4>(<i>Written after a surfeit of the Illustrated Papers.</i>)</h4>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Ye Royalties of England, how beautiful ye are!</p>
<p>The special artists claim you, they track you from afar.</p>
<p>In uniforms and diamonds, with sceptre and with crown,</p>
<p>In many a picture-paper those artists set you down.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>And thus the British public may gaze upon its Queen&mdash;</p>
<p>They make her small, but dignified, of most majestic mien.</p>
<p>She smiles&mdash;the artist marks her; she frowns&mdash;the artist quails,</p>
<p>And soothes himself by drawing H.R.H. the Prince of <span class="sc">Wales</span>.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>He draws him at foundation stones, a trowel in his hand</p>
<p>(The point of silver trowels I ne'er could understand);</p>
<p>He draws him opening railways, or turning sods of grass,</p>
<p>And he draws him as a Colonel, in helmet and cuirasse.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>We see him dressed for London, a-riding in the Row&mdash;</p>
<p>I wonder if he ever finds his London pleasures slow;</p>
<p>And we see him down at Sandringham, his country-home in Norfolk,</p>
<p>Where the Royal pair are much beloved, especially by poor folk.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>And oft at public dinners, in Garter and in Star,</p>
<p>We see his Royal Highness enjoying his cigar.</p>
<p>I wish they wouldn't vary quite so much his Royal figure.</p>
<p>For they sometimes make him leaner, and sometimes make him bigger.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>But, be that as it may, I feel that, while my life endures,</p>
<p>I know by heart my Prince's face, my future King's contours.</p>
<p>A stiff examination in the Prince of <span class="sc">Wales</span> I'd pass,</p>
<p>And in all his princely attitudes they'd give me a first-class.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>The Duke of <span class="sc">York</span>, our Sailor Prince, I think I've got him pat;</p>
<p>I've never seen him face to face, but what's the odds of that?</p>
<p>In illustrated papers I have watched him every day</p>
<p>Since he went and popped the question to the pretty Princess <span class="sc">May</span>.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>I've seen them plain or coloured in fifty different styles,</p>
<p>Just like a pair of turtle-doves, all bills and coos and smiles.</p>
<p>I never saw a turtle-dove that smiled upon its pet afore,</p>

<h2 class="sans">SEEING THE ROYAL WEDDING PRESENTS.</h2>

<h4>(<i>A Sketch at the Imperial Institute</i>.)</h4>

<p class="ind1"><span class="outdent"><span class="sc">Scene</span>&mdash;</span><i>The North Gallery on a Saturday afternoon, with the
thermometer at considerably over 80° in the shade. The presents
are arranged behind a long barrier, in front of which the Spectators
form a double "queue," the outer rank facing in the
opposite direction to the inner line, and both moving at an average
rate of one foot every five minutes.</i></p>

<p><i>The Attendants (spasmodically).</i> Pass along there, please. Keep
moving!</p>

<p class="ind1"><span class="outdent">[<i>The crowd close to the barrier</i></span> <i>either cannot or will not pay
the slightest attention to these injunctions, and remain
placidly gazing at whatever happens to be in front of them;
the people in the outside line, who can see just enough to
tantalise them, begin to exhibit signs of impatience.</i></p>

<p><i>A Sour-looking Spinster.</i> Well, I'm sure! They <i>might</i> remember
there's others that would like to have a look besides themselves!
Some of them seem to have made up their minds to spend the whole
<i>day</i> here! (<i>With a withering glance at a stout lady in the inner
rank.</i>) How anyone can call herself a lady and spend fifteen minutes
downright gloating at nothing but cigarette cases&mdash;well, I should be
sorry to be so disobliging <i>myself</i>!</p>

<p class="ind1"><span class="outdent">[<i>The stout lady,</i></span> <i>who has exhausted the cigarette cases long ago,
but can't move on until those in front of her have thoroughly
inspected the jewels, fans herself with a pocket-handkerchief,
and pretends not to have heard.</i></p>

<p><i>A Cheery Old Lady (to her Grand-daughter).</i> Well, they <i>do</i>
make you wait, there's no denying&mdash;but we shall see everythink
some time or other. 'Ot, <span class="sc">Minnie</span>? Yes, it <i>is</i> 'ot, and they're
pushing in front as well as beyind, now; but lor, my dear, we
must put up with sech things when we come out like this. And
you can ketch a glimpse in and between like, as it is. I can see
the top of a Grandfather's Clock. It won't take us 'alf an hour
now, at the rate we're going, to git round the turn, and then we
shall be next the barrier, and 'ave a little more room. There,
they're beginning to move a bit. (<i>The line advances about a yard.</i>)
Now we're getting along beautiful!</p>

<p><i>A Purple-faced Old Gentleman (in a perspiration).</i> It's scandalous!
These people inside aren't <i>attempting</i> to move along. (<i>To
the inner rank.</i>) Will you kindly pass on, and give others a
chance? <i>Do</i> pass along there! (<i>The people in the inner row maintain
a bland unconsciousness, which is too much for his feelings.</i>)
D&mdash;n it! why can't you pass along when you're asked to?</p>

<p><i>The Usual Comic Cockney.</i> It's no good torkin' perlitely to 'em,
guv'nor; you touch some on 'em up with your umberella. Why,
there's two old ladies aside o' me that 'ave gone and 'ipnotised
theirselves starin' at silver kendlesticks!</p>

<p><i>A Plaintive Female (to a smart young constable).</i> Oh, Mr. Policeman,
<i>do</i> make 'em 'urry up there!</p>

<p class="ind1"><span class="outdent">[<i>The constable prudently</i></span> <i>declines to attempt the impossible, and
merely smiles with pitying superiority.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lavender Salt (who has insisted on her husband escorting
her).</i> <span class="sc">Lavender</span>, what a frightful crush! I don't believe we've
moved for the last twenty minutes, and I'm nearly dead with the
heat!</p>

<p><i>Mr. L. S. (with irritating common sense).</i> Well, <span class="sc">Mimosa</span>, you
don't suppose <i>I'm</i> enjoying myself? After all, if you don't like the
crush, the remedy's simple. You've only to step out of it into the
grounds, you know&mdash;there is some air <i>there</i>!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L. S.</i> What? and give up our places after going through
so much? No, <span class="sc">Lavender</span>, it would be too absurd to have to go
away without seeing the Royal Presents after all!</p>

<p><i>Mr. L. S.</i> But is it worth all this pushing and squeezing? Why,
you can see much the same sort of thing any day in perfect comfort
by simply walking down Bond Street!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L. S.</i> You wouldn't say so if you had the least scrap of imagination!
It isn't the things themselves one comes to see&mdash;it's the
sentiment <i>attached</i> to them!</p>

<p><i>Mr. L. S.</i> Oh, is <i>that</i> it? Well, I can make out the upper part
of a weighing machine over your shoulder, but I can't say I discover
any particular sentiment attached to <i>that</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. L. S. (impatiently).</i> Oh, if you choose to sneer at <i>everything</i>,
of course you can, but it's looking at things like these that
makes us the loyal nation we are, <span class="sc">Lavender</span>!</p>

<p><i>Mr. L. S.</i> My dear <span class="sc">Mimosa</span>, I give you my solemn word that if
I remain opposite those Chippendale bookcases ten minutes longer I
shall become a gibbering anarchist! Surely we can be loyal without
such a painful resemblance to a box of dried figs.</p>

bloomin' Presents as what <i>you</i> 'ave?</p>

<p><i>The P.-f. O. G.</i> You've no right to push in out of your turn,
Sir. You must take your proper place down at the end of the <i>queue</i>
and wait, like everybody else.</p>

<p><i>The New Comer.</i> What, all the way down there, and 'ow long
might I have to wait, now?</p>

<p><i>The P.-f. O. G. (with tremendous dignity).</i> That I can't say, Sir. I
can only tell you this&mdash;that I have been standing here myself for
over three-quarters of an hour without advancing ten yards or seeing
anything distinctly, and so have all these ladies and gentlemen.</p>

<p><i>The New Comer.</i> Hor, hor, hor! D'jear that, <span class="sc">Joe</span>? Ten yards
in three-quarters of an hour! What price snails, eh? Well, Sir,
if that's <i>your</i> ideer of amusin' yourself on a warm afternoon, it ain't
mine, so you'll excuse me and my friend 'ere joinin' your little
percession. Don't lose 'art, Sir, keep on at it. You'll <i>git</i> there

<p class="ind1"><span class="outdent">[<i>They pass on with ribald laughter,</i></span> <i>to the general relief.

<h4><span class="sc">Along the Barrier.</span></h4>

<p>Now we shan't be <i>nearly</i> so squeeged, <span class="sc">Minnie</span>! There's nothing
partickler to look at just yet, except kerridges.... It's not the
smallest use telling us to hurry, my good woman, because we can't
move till those in front choose to go on.... Look at the 'arness,
<span class="sc">Minnie</span>&mdash;pretty 'arness, ain't it? with their crest on it and all!...
Well, I call it shabby givin' 'em a kerridge without even so much
as a old moke to dror it. I'd ha' done it 'ansome, or not at all....
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg 29]</span>
Lor, look at the dust on all the
furniture&mdash;it <i>will</i> want cleanin'
up!... That's a beautiful gong,
<span class="sc">Minnie</span>; see, that's the thing
they 'it it with.... Ain't that
a comfortable looking chair in
red moroccer? That'll be for
the 'all porter to set in, I expect&mdash;there's
a 'at in it. Lor no,
my dear, it 'ud ha' been a better
lookin' 'at than what that is, if
it was one of the presents, depend
on it! There's a weighin' machine....
Fancy goin' and
givin' them a thing like that!
Oh, I expect it's for them to
weigh theirselves with. Ah,
'ere come the <i>Jewels</i> now. Now
we <i>shall</i> see somethink!... I
don't see <i>our</i> present yet, do you,
<span class="sc">'Arriet</span>? There's old Uncle
<span class="sc">Bill's</span>. See, that dimond and
pearl necklace. Well, if they
ain't gone and put it down as
"Persented by six 'undred and
fifty ladies of England!" And
the old man savin' up his screw
for weeks for it&mdash;he <i>will</i> be 'urt
when he 'ears of it! Some
bloke's gone and given 'em a
pillar-post box. I thought of
sendin' the one at our corner,
on'y it wouldn't come out easy:
and what with the copper bein'
on his beat&mdash;why, I decided I'd
give 'em somethink else....
Walking-sticks? Why, he
wouldn't want more if he was a&mdash;a
centipede!... I wonder
where they'll <i>put</i> all the things,
I'm sure! 'Ullo, a pearl and
dimond tiarer, made o' cardboard.
I 'ope they thanked 'im
nicely for <i>that</i>! Why, that's
on'y a model, like. Well, and
a very good model, too, what
I call eckernomical.... Look
at those <i>lovely</i> toast-racks!...
<span class="sc">Lavender</span>, what a magnificent
old mirror!&mdash;Elizabethan, I expect.
I wonder who gave <i>that?</i>...
Oh, me and <span class="sc">'Arriet</span> give
'er <i>that</i>, mum.... Oh, dear, I
wish I was them, to have all
these presents.... Why, my
dear, it doesn't matter to <i>them</i>&mdash;they
have everything lovely as it is!... <span class="sc">'Arriet</span>, when
you and me git married, we'll 'ave a show of all <i>our</i> presents&mdash;not
'ere, there won't be no room. We'll take the Agricultural
'All, and have a catalogue and everythink. "Set of Elizabethian
sheep's trotters, from the Hearl of <span class="sc">Alamode</span>." eh? "Pound of
Queen Anne saveloys, from the Markis o' <span class="sc">Mile-end</span>." "Yard
o' flypaper, from the Dook o' <span class="sc">Shoreditch</span>." "Packet of 'airpins,
persented by seven 'underd lydies of Whitechapel." "Donkey-barrer
an' kerridge-rug, from the residents in the Ole Kent Road."
Etceterer ... I do wish you wouldn't go on so foolish! Why,
if someone hain't sent her a set o' straw soles to keep her shoes
dry&mdash;what <i>next</i>, I wonder!... And a very sensible thing too.... Well, my dear,
I'm sure nothing can't be too good for her,
and they've certainly been set up with every blessing a young couple
can require&mdash;and may they live long to enjoy them!</p>

<li><i>Question.</i> Do you prefer Bisley
to Wimbledon?</li>

<li><i>Answer.</i> Officially, yes; as a
civilian, no.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Why do you make the
distinction?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Because I go to Bisley in
a double capacity.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Why do you prefer Bisley
to Wimbledon officially?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Because there are no distractions,
and the ranges are
less subject to atmospheric interruption.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Why do you prefer Wimbledon
to Bisley as a civilian?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Because Wimbledon was
an extremely cheery place,
where you could entertain your
friends to your heart's content,
and have a generally good time
of it.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Can you not obtain the
same advantages at Bisley?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Certainly not. You are
in the neighbourhood of Woking
Cemetery, and that melancholy
spot influences its surroundings.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> But were you not always
regretting the attractions of Wimbledon when you were in
Surrey?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Certainly, because they lured me from work.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Do you still regret them?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> More than ever, because they were certainly pleasanter than
the attractions of Bisley.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> And now, in conclusion, what do you think of this year's
shooting?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> The same as former years.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> What do you mean by that?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> That those who win owe their good shots to flukes, and those
who fail have to thank their rifles, and the state of the weather.</li>

<h4><i>A Song of Sympathetic Suggestion.</i></h4>

<blockquote><p>
["Poor Mrs. <span class="sc">Nickleby</span>, who had at no time been
remarkable for the possession of a very clear
understanding, had been reduced by the late
changes in affairs to a most complicated state of
perplexity....</p>

<p>"'I don't know what to think, one way or
other, my dear,' said Mrs. <span class="sc">Nickleby</span>; '<span class="sc">Nicholas</span>
is so violent, and your uncle has so much composure,
that I can only hear what he says, and not
what <span class="sc">Nicholas</span> does. Never mind&mdash;don't let us
talk any more about it.'...</p>

<p>"Now Mrs. <span class="sc">Nickleby</span> was not the sort of
person to be told anything in a hurry, or rather to
comprehend anything of peculiar delicacy or importance
on a short notice....</p>

<p>"'Anybody who had come in upon us suddenly
would have supposed that I was confusing and
distracting, instead of making things plainer;
upon my word they would.'...</p>

<p>"'I am very sorry indeed,' said Mrs. <span class="sc">Nickleby</span>.
'I am very sorry indeed for all this. I really
don't know what would be the best to do, and
that's the truth;... but if it could be settled in
any friendly manner&mdash;and some fair arrangement
was come to, so that we undertook to have fish
twice a week, and a pudding once, or a dumpling,
or something of that sort, I do think it might be
very satisfactory and pleasant for all parties.'</p>

<p>"This compromise, which was proposed with
abundance of tears and sighs, not exactly meeting
the point at issue, nobody took any notice of it."</p>

so the <i>Times</i> special lately wrote, "took
place between Bishop <span class="sc">Tucker</span> and Monseigneur
<span class="sc">Hirth</span>," with a view to amicably
arranging their respective missions. Monseigneur
<span class="sc">Hirth</span> wished to sing the old nigger
melody of "<i>Out ob de way ole Dan Tucker</i>."
Imperial Commissioner objected. Bishop
<span class="sc">Tucker</span>, lineal descendant of the celebrated
little <i>Thomas</i> who "cried for his
supper," wanted to have all the black and
white bread to himself according to the
ancient nursery tradition of the <span class="sc">Tucker</span>
family. Commissioner, quite a <span class="sc">Gallio</span> in
his way, wouldn't hear of it. Ultimately
the two ecclesiastical antagonists came to
terms, the Commissioner (Our Own) wisely
observing that "as the object of both missions
was a spiritual one, there ought to be
no Hirthly ground for disagreement."</p>

<p class="ind">"<span class="sc">Has Left but the Name.</span>"&mdash;The intention of the original
starters of the Aquarium was presumably to exhibit fish of all sorts,
all alive oh! and quite at home. Nowadays, very little about fish
is to be found in the advertisements. The fish are, it may be
supposed, "taken for granted." They are conspicuous by their
absence; but instead you read how "a human being dives," how
somebody conjures, how there are "miraculous feats," and "four-legged
dancers," and "baby elephants" waltzing and drum-playing;
how somebody of some importance "walks upside down in mid-air;"
how there are "serpentine" dancers, "pantomimists," "duettists,"
and, finally, the "boxing kangaroo," so that altogether the
Aquarium may still congratulate itself on a show of about the
"queerest, oddest fish" in the world.</p>

<h3>THE LATEST PARISIAN "ROMANCE."</h3>

<h4>(<i>Translated from the original French Canard.</i>)</h4>

<p>THEY were hunting him down. They had traced him from spot
to spot. Now he was in the barracks bribing the Army, now in the
Ministerial Bureau offering gold to the Members of the Government,
now in the office of the leading newspaper arranging for back
pages in advertisements at double the scale price. His pernicious
influence was felt everywhere. The whole body was permeated with
a poisonous atmosphere of corruption.</p>

<p>"We shall have him now," said the first detective, as he looked
to the lock of his revolver.</p>

<p>"No doubt about it," returned the other, as he loosed his sword
in its scabbard. "He cannot escape us."</p>

<p>Then the force of cavalry, infantry and artillery in attendance
raised a stealthy cheer. It had been difficult to bring the charges
home to the accused, but they had succeeded. It seemed impossible
to prove his identity, but now they had surrounded him. It was
only a question of a few minutes, and he would be their prisoner.</p>

<p>The detectives entered the <i>café</i>. They looked around them. They
could see no one answering to his description. All who were there
had black beards, black shaggy hair. They could see no red tresses,
no yellow Dundreary whiskers and prominent front teeth. Where
could he be?</p>

<p>"Yes, there is one diner who has ordered a singular meal," replied
a <i>garçon</i>, in reply to a question. "He has asked for turtle-soup,
raw herrings, raw beef, raw mutton chops, plum-pudding and a
barrel of porter-beer."</p>

<p>"It must be he," cried the detectives, in a breath; "only an
Englishman would want such a meal."</p>

<p>"And he asked for the <i>Times</i> and <i>Punch</i>," added the waiter.</p>

<p>"Proof conclusive of nationality;" and in a moment the man was
surrounded and seized.</p>

<p>"You dare not touch me," he shouted, battling with his captors.
"I am sacred, and if you offer violence you pledge your country to
a terrible war!"</p>

<p>Impressed by the stranger's vehemence, the detectives released him.
Once free, he threw off his black wig, took off his false nose, and put
on his blue spectacles. Then he gazed around him proudly.</p>

<p>"We ask your pardon, M. l'Ambassadeur," said the police.</p>

<p>"It is granted," returned their now-released prisoner, and he
entered his carriage. "I would have preferred to preserve my <i>incognito</i>,
but your interference has compelled me to reveal my identity. And
now, home."</p>

<p>And the coachman drove the Ambassador to a grand mansion in the
Rue Faubourg St. Honoré.</p>

<h4><span class="sc">Sequel</span> (<i>from the original English</i>).</h4>

<p>And when the Ambassador read the above, he came back to his
native land, and observed, "I think I have had enough of this."</p>

<p>And everyone at home agreed with him.</p>

<p>We are delighted&mdash;everyone is
delighted, and that is much the

<span class="sc">Bancroft</span> is by this time on the
high road to recovery from the
effects of what might have been a
serious accident. The "inimitable"
was in a Hansom, when
the horse suddenly fell. Had
Mrs. <span class="sc">Bancroft</span> been only
what is professionally known
as "A Walking Lady," this
could not have happened. The
<i>Daily Telegraph's</i> account of it
informed us that "Mr. <span class="sc">Blakeley</span>,
now of the Criterion Theatre,
and once a member of Mr. and
Mrs. <span class="sc">Bancroft's</span> own company,
who was happily passing immediately
after the occurrence, was
the means of having the lady
taken to her private residence."
Mr. <span class="sc">Blakeley</span> is always "happy"
in any part he undertakes, <ins title="T.N.:'he touched nothing without embellishing it'"><i>nihil
tetigit quod non ornavit</i></ins>, and no
doubt he was "happily passing,"
perhaps gaily whistling, lightly
stepping, merrily twirling a stick,
and walking along "thinking of
nothing at all," when he became
aware of the danger to the popular
ex-manageress, which at once
changed his note from a tenner to
an alto: in fact alto-gether altered
it. [The above comment would
have been impossible had the
reporter stated that, "Happily
for Mrs. <span class="sc">Bancroft</span>, Mr. <span class="sc">Blakeley</span>,
&amp;c., &amp;c., was passing at the

<h3>FROM PROFESSOR MUDDLE.</h3>

Ever since I read that inspired
work, <i>Alice in Blunderland</i>, I
do not seem to be able to give
a correct version of any of the
poems I have long been accustomed
to repeat or sing. After
dinner the other night I was
asked to sing, and gave a well-known
song as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">

<p class="i2">No words need then be said;</p>
<p>Or kiss me sweetly with thine ears,</p>

<p>The thirst that in my body burns</p>
<p class="i2">Demands both food and wine,</p>
<p>So when I next shall call on thee</p>
<p class="i2">You'll know I've come to dine.</p>

<p class="i2">Not so much honouring me</p>

<p class="i2">It all for love of thee.</p>
<p>But I returned it through the post&mdash;</p>

<h2 class="sans">ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<h4>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h4>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, July 10.</i>&mdash;Glad the sitting's over;
often get a little mixed here; never so magnificently as to-night.
Reached 9th Clause Home-Rule Bill, which settles question of Irish
Representation in Imperial Parliament. When Mr. G. brought in
his Bill in 1886, he proposed to exclude Irish Members. Remember
very well the cheer that filled the Chamber when that announcement
made on introduction of Bill. Those were, as <span class="sc">Pat O'Brien</span> used to
say, "the days of all-night sittings." Irish Members stood in bitter
implacable attitude of obstruction. At prospect of clearing them out,
giving Great Britain some peace in its own Parliament, the hearts
of Members leaped for joy. Seemed at moment as if this bribe would
be enough to carry the Bill.</p>

<p>Then came time for reflection; chance of reviewing opportunities.
<span class="sc">Joseph's</span> rapid insight perceived in this arrangement a stab at the
Union. In phrase which <span class="sc">Squire of Malwood</span> to-night obligingly
recalled he had written, "The key of the position is the maintenance
of the full representation of Ireland in the Imperial Parliament."</p>

<p>Mr. G., profiting by experience, proposes in present Bill to maintain
Irish representation in slightly modified number. That would
seem to cut ground from under <span class="sc">Joseph's</span> clinging feet. What he
passionately, persistently demanded in 1886, is conceded in 1893. If
he cannot abear other provisions of the Bill, he must surely defend
the one that retains Irish Members at Westminster. Must he,
indeed? Those who think so, know not <span class="sc">Joseph</span>. For some men the
fence might seem a hopelessly stiff one. <span class="sc">Joseph</span> takes it as an
ordinary item in the day's work. No apology; no retraction; no
explanation. Black was black in 1886. He, at risk of severing
long friendships, said so, and was right. In 1893 black is white. He,
anxious only for the prevalence of truth, says so, and is right again.</p>

<p>This would have been pretty picture for a July night; but anyone
could have drawn it. In House of Commons it's as common as
pastels on the pavement. <span class="sc">Joseph</span> went the step further that marks
the wide gulf between genius and mediocrity. Having declared
that in 1893 he, impelled by irresistible conscience and unfathomable
love for his country, would vote against what in 1886 he (subject to
same influence) described as the key of the position, <span class="sc">Joey C.</span> turned
upon his right hon. friends on the Treasury Bench, and with manly
emotion that brought tears to the eyes of the Member for Sark,
deplored their inconsistency.</p>

<p>"What I like about <span class="sc">Joseph</span>," said the Member for Sark, "is his
thoroughness. On finding himself in this new pit, he might have
stopped at the bottom and said nothing till the storm had blown over.
Or, thinking that a mean evasion, he might have defended the course
he has adopted. Those are the alternatives presented to ordinary
mankind: only to <span class="sc">Joseph</span> comes the idea of standing up and indignantly
belabouring Mr. G. and <span class="sc">John Morley</span> for indulgence in the
unpardonable sin of inconsistency!"</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span>, <span class="sc">Joseph</span>, <span class="sc">Sage of Queen Anne's
Gate</span>, and <span class="sc">John Redmond</span>, unite their forces against Government.

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Tim Healy</span> is an honest man and a loyal colleague.
But we are all weak on some point. Temptation irresistible to <span class="sc">Tim</span>
is to appropriate other people's rows. To-night's row distinctly
and exclusively <span class="sc">Sexton's</span>. Yet <span class="sc">Tim</span> promptly came to the front,
and remained there throughout the storm. The one clear impression
amidst confusing uproar was that <span class="sc">Tim</span> was bobbing on top of the
turbulence like a cork on the apex of a water-spout.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodrick</span> began it, and while storm raged sat silent, astonished
at his own moderation. Had merely remarked that the Irish people
were impecunious and garrulous. As an Irishman himself ought to
know something on point. <span class="sc">Saunderson</span>, another member of a gifted
race, explained that, on the whole, he was inclined to regard remark
as complimentary. <span class="sc">Sexton</span>, taking a different view, retorted with
observation that <span class="sc">Brodrick's</span> language was grossly impertinent.
Chairman, appealed to on point of order, gave a nice ruling. It is
now established among Parliamentary precedents that the phrase
"grossly impertinent," if addressed to an individual, is rank blasphemy;
when applied to a thing 'tis but a choleric word. Committee
might usefully have applied itself to consideration of this
delicate distinction. "Instead of which," as the magistrate once
said, it went about roaring like a famished lion.</p>

<p>For some minutes everyone seemed on his legs. <span class="sc">Carmarthen</span> had
advantage over most Members by reason of his more than six feet
length; <span class="sc">Grandolph</span>, feeling old emotions stirred within him, took
prominent part in the fray; Mr. G., leaning across the table, fixed
his glowing eyes on <span class="sc">Grandolph</span>, and warned him that his conduct
was not calculated to assist the Committee in its dilemma; the
voice of <span class="sc">T. W. Russell</span> was heard in the land; <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span> had
much to say; Dr. <span class="sc">Tanner</span> broke long silence with a shout; even
<span class="sc">Justin McCarthy</span> was seen on his feet, and was howled at as if he
had been discovered in the act of stealing the Chairman's pocket-handkerchief.
But <span class="sc">Tim</span> topped them all. They were intermittent;
he continuous. Whenever there was approach to pause in the
clamour, <span class="sc">Tim's</span> strident voice filled it up with genial observation,
"Name! Name!" they roared at him. "Drag him out," was the
advice given by one forlorn legislator. In delirious delight of the
rapturous hour <span class="sc">Tim</span> took no notice of these objurgations and interruptions.
"It's not your funeral," an envious countryman snarled
in his ear. Certainly not; but that should make no difference.
<span class="sc">Tim</span> would improve the opportunity to whomsoever it might belong;
and he did.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;None. But we had a cheerful row.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;"><a href="images/036-600.png"><img src="images/036a-200.png" width="200" height="263" alt="'Waiting to Spring.'" /></a>
<p class="center">"Waiting to Spring."</p></div>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Some excellent speaking to-night, and a walking-match,
in which, lap after lap,
Government won. <span class="sc">Wallace</span> led
off with speech sparkling with
point; the more effective by
contrast with stolid manner.
House crowded and applausive;
always grateful to have something
fresh; get it from <span class="sc">Wallace</span>,
both in manner and matter.
<span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span>, following later,
unusually bitter; pegged away
at Bill and Government
for half
an hour, and sat
down with assertion
that such a
Government was
not worth attacking.
Mr. G., who
had listened to
<span class="sc">Wallace's</span>
home-thrusts
with face appreciative
of their
humour, was unaccountably
disturbed
by <span class="sc">Prince
Arthur's</span> commentaries.
He sat immediately
opposite, waiting
to spring; meanwhile,
with legs
crossed and arms tightly folded, literally holding himself in. On
his feet with catapultic force when <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span>, gracefully
gathering his skirts, sat down. A Government not worthy of attack.
Ho! A Government that had failed to adhere to the main principles
of its policy. Ha! But there was another Government which, in
1886, had denounced as dishonest a revision of judicial rents in Ireland,
and a few months later had passed Bill revising them. Had
<span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span> belonged to that Government? If so, how did he
uplift this lofty standard of action, than which no Pharisee that
ever lived in Judea carried it higher? This and much more Mr. G.
declaimed at top of voice, with flashing eyes, and exuberant gestures,
cheers and counter cheers filling House. Naturally <span class="sc">Joseph</span> followed
with some kind words about "my right hon. friend."
<span class="sc">Squire of Malwood</span>, long silent, could not resist temptation to
plunge in. House went off to dinner exhausted by the tornado of
bitter, brilliant speech.</p>

<p>Dull enough after dinner, when walking-match began. Performance
announced for ten o'clock; began punctually; <span class="sc">Mellor</span> acted
as starter. Course, round the Division Lobbies and back to seats.
Time, by Benson's chronometer, varied from 16 mins. 25 secs.
to 18 mins. 3 secs. Programme included eighteen races; numbered
Clause 9 to 26 inclusive; betting 5 to 1 on Government to pull
through; some uncertainty round first division; talk about plungers
in Ministerial team; when made known that majority was 27, it
was seen that Government were safe. Interest in subsequent races
fell away as Government majority mounted up. For some of the
events the Opposition did not appear at starting-post; Government
walked over.</p>

<p>"Demmit, <span class="sc">Douglas</span>," said Lord <span class="sc">Nom Toddy</span>, coming in mopping
his brow, after eighth Division, "this is not good enough. Next
Thursday I shall send my man down, and let him do the walking
round. No use keeping a dog and barking yourself."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Clauses 9 to 26 added to Home-Rule Bill.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Don't Keir Hardie</span> made bold bid to-day for cheap
advertisement. Motion for Address to <span class="sc">Queen</span> in congratulation on
Royal Marriage. <span class="sc">Don't Keir</span> tacked himself on to performance
with attempted Amendment on behalf of the poor and needy. Found
no probability of anyone seconding his Amendment, which therefore
could not be put. Still, served his purpose; suggested visions of
portrait of Benefactor of the People (penny plain, twopence coloured)
hung in all the cottage homes of England.</p>

<p>"Curious," says the Member for Sark, "how rapidly <span class="sc">Don't Keir
Hardie</span> has played himself out; perhaps rather notable than curious.
House of Commons is the quickest machine ever invented for taking
the measure of a man. Has looked at Member for West Ham,
measured him, weighed him, and set him aside. When, less than
a year ago, he came down, with his brass band and his trumpets
tootling, he was <span class="sc">Don't Keir Hardie</span>. Now, if I may say so, the
boot's on the other leg; it's the House of Commons that Don't Keir
for Hardie."</p>

<h3>QUEER QUERIES.</h3>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">A Municipal Hall.</span>&mdash;I see the County Council are thinking of
spending nearly a million of the ratepayers' money in buying a site
for a municipal palace in Parliament Street, because the members&mdash;pending
the time when they are all elected to the Legislature&mdash;want
to be as close to it as possible. Why not let them be still closer, in
Westminster Hall itself, which is now untenanted? Or if the
members don't like that, why not make a working arrangement with
the House of Commons to use that chamber in the mornings before
the M.P.'s come down to it? This would be something like an
"in-and-out" clause, and would save no end of money.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="sc">True Economist.</span></p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">Rewards to Raconteurs.</span>&mdash;I am considered a first-rate storyteller
and conversationalist; indeed, few dinner parties (at Lower
Tooting) can get on without me. Do you think I could get elected
to the Reform Club without paying the entrance subscription? I
see that some members of that club have been left £2000 each as a
reward for "brightening the evenings" of a deceased member, and
I feel certain that had the testator known <i>me</i>, he would have
increased my legacy to £4000 at least. My sparkling powers of
conversation are often called a "gift," but I don't want them to be
a gift if I could get anything for them.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
